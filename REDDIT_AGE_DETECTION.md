# Reddit Age Detection System 📅🗣️

## Overview
Enhanced the fact-checking system to use Reddit discussions to determine when claims first emerged, enabling more targeted and accurate fact-check searches.

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**Before**: Fact-check searches used basic timeline strategies that often missed the optimal search window for claims.

**After**: Reddit discussions reveal when claims first appeared in public discourse, allowing precise targeting of fact-check database searches.

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Reddit Age Analysis
```javascript
const redditAgeAnalysis = await searchRedditForClaimAge(claim);
```

1. **Search Reddit**: Searches news-focused subreddits (r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, etc.)
2. **Timeline Analysis**: Analyzes post timestamps to find earliest mentions
3. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluates reliability based on post volume and distribution
4. **Age Calculation**: Determines how many days old the claim likely is

### Step 2: Enhanced Fact-Check Search
```javascript
const factCheckResults = await searchFactChecks(claim, videoUrl, caption);
```

1. **Targeted Timeline**: Uses Reddit age to set optimal `maxAgeDays` parameters
2. **Smart Strategy**: Adapts search strategy based on claim age:
   - **Recent claims** (≤45 days): Start with targeted 60+ day searches
   - **Medium claims** (≤180 days): Start with 200+ day searches  
   - **Older claims** (≤730 days): Start with 800+ day searches
   - **Very old claims** (>730 days): Start with multi-year searches

## 📊 Age Detection Algorithm

### Reddit Analysis Process
1. **Term Extraction**: Extracts key terms from claim for search
2. **Multi-Subreddit Search**: Searches 4 news-focused subreddits
3. **Post Collection**: Gathers up to 25 posts per subreddit
4. **Timeline Sorting**: Sorts posts by creation time (oldest first)
5. **Age Calculation**: Measures days from earliest post to present

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH**: 10+ posts clustered within 30 days
- **MEDIUM**: 5+ posts within 90 days  
- **LOW**: <5 posts or scattered timeline

### Example Reddit Analysis Results
```javascript
{
  estimatedAgeDays: 45,
  confidence: 'high',
  earliestPostDate: '2024-11-01T10:30:00.000Z',
  latestPostDate: '2024-12-15T18:45:00.000Z',
  totalPosts: 12,
  postTimespan: 44, // days between first and last post
  samplePosts: [
    {
      title: "Breaking: New study claims...",
      subreddit: "news",
      date: "11/1/2024",
      score: 1250
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Timeline Strategy Examples

### Recent Claim (30 days old)
```
📊 Reddit analysis: Claim is ~30 days old (high confidence)
📅 Earliest Reddit mention: 11/15/2024
🎯 Optimized search strategy: targeted: 45 days (Reddit-based)
```

**Search Strategy**:
1. Targeted: 45 days (Reddit-based) ✅
2. Last 90 days (if needed)
3. Last year (if needed)
4. All time (if needed)

### Older Claim (400 days old)
```
📊 Reddit analysis: Claim is ~400 days old (medium confidence)  
📅 Earliest Reddit mention: 9/20/2023
🎯 Optimized search strategy: targeted: 470 days (Reddit-based)
```

**Search Strategy**:
1. Targeted: 470 days (Reddit-based) ✅
2. Last 5 years (if needed)
3. All time (if needed)

### No Reddit Data Available
```
⚠️ Reddit age analysis inconclusive (0 posts), using fallback video detection
🎯 Using video-based strategy 0 as fallback
```

**Fallback Strategy**: Uses original video metadata detection

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### 1. **More Accurate Results**
- Searches in the right time window when claims first emerged
- Avoids missing relevant fact-checks that occurred shortly after claims appeared
- Reduces irrelevant results from wrong time periods

### 2. **Better Performance** 
- Starts with optimal search parameters instead of trying multiple strategies
- Reduces API calls to fact-check databases
- Faster results for users

### 3. **Enhanced Context**
- Shows when claims first appeared in public discourse
- Provides timeline of Reddit discussions
- Helps users understand claim evolution

## 🔍 Integration Points

### Enhanced Summary Output
```
📅 Claim Age: ~45 days old (high confidence from Reddit analysis)
🗣️ Reddit Timeline: 12 discussions found, earliest on 11/1/2024
🔍 Search Strategy: Found results using targeted: 45 days (Reddit-based) search
```

### Data Flow Integration
1. **Claim Extraction** → Extract verifiable claim from video
2. **Reddit Age Analysis** → Determine when claim first appeared ⭐ NEW
3. **Targeted Fact-Check Search** → Use Reddit age for optimal search ⭐ ENHANCED
4. **Article Content Analysis** → Analyze actual article content
5. **Final Verdict** → Combine all evidence with Reddit context

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

## 📊 Subreddit Coverage

### Primary News Subreddits
- **r/news**: Breaking news and current events
- **r/worldnews**: International news stories
- **r/politics**: Political claims and discussions  
- **r/breakingnews**: Recent breaking stories

### Backup Subreddits (if needed)
- **r/nottheonion**: Unusual but true stories
- **r/OutOfTheLoop**: Contextual discussions about trending topics

## 🔮 Expected Impact

### For Recent Claims (0-60 days old)
- **Before**: Often missed by generic 30-day searches
- **After**: Precisely targeted based on when Reddit discussions started

### For Medium Claims (60-365 days old)  
- **Before**: Required multiple search attempts to find right timeframe
- **After**: Direct targeting based on Reddit timeline analysis

### For Old Claims (1+ years old)
- **Before**: Inefficient searches through recent timeframes first
- **After**: Skip to appropriate multi-year search strategies immediately

## ⚠️ Considerations

### Limitations
- **Reddit Coverage**: Not all claims get discussed on Reddit
- **Search Quality**: Depends on Reddit search API reliability
- **English Focus**: Primarily works for English-language claims
- **Rate Limits**: Reddit API has rate limiting (handled with delays)

### Fallback Systems
- **Video Metadata**: Falls back to original video-based age detection
- **Progressive Search**: Still tries multiple timeframes if targeted search fails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if Reddit search fails
