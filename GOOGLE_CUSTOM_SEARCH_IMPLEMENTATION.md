# Google Custom Search Age Detection System 🔍📰

## Problem Solved: Reddit Age Detection Failure ❌➡️✅

**The Reddit Issue:**
- Reddit search returned current discussions (0 days old) instead of actual event timing
- Expected: Charlie Kirk event ~15-16 days ago
- Got: Current chatter about an older event
- **Root Cause**: Reddit discussions ≠ Event occurrence dates

**The Solution: Google Custom Search**
You were absolutely right - we need to use **actual news articles** with real publication dates, not community discussions!

## 🎯 New Google Custom Search Approach

### How It Works
1. **Smart Query Generation**: AI creates targeted search queries from video context (claim + caption + transcription)
2. **News Article Search**: Uses Google Custom Search API to find actual news articles
3. **Date Extraction**: Parses publication dates from article metadata
4. **Timeline Analysis**: Analyzes when news broke to determine event age
5. **Targeted Fact-Check**: Uses accurate age to target fact-check searches

## 📊 Expected Results vs Reddit

### Charlie Kirk Example

**Reddit Approach (Failed)**:
```
❌ Result: 0 days old (current discussions)
❌ Method: Discussion chatter analysis
❌ Sources: Reddit posts about the event
❌ Problem: Discussions ≠ Event timing
```

**Google Custom Search Approach (Expected)**:
```
✅ Result: 15 days old (actual news publication dates)
✅ Method: News article timeline analysis  
✅ Sources: CNN, AP News, Reuters articles
✅ Solution: Publication dates = Event timing
```

### Sample Expected Results
```
📰 SAMPLE NEWS ARTICLES FOUND:
1. CNN: "Charlie Kirk shot in assassination attempt at rally"

   📅 Published: 9/6/2025 (15 days ago)

3. Reuters: "Charlie Kirk hospitalized after assassination attempt"
   📅 Published: 9/7/2025 (14 days ago)

📊 TIMELINE ANALYSIS:
📅 9/6/2025: 12 articles (news breaks) ← EVENT DATE
📅 9/7/2025: 8 articles (follow-up coverage)
📅 9/8/2025: 3 articles (continued coverage)

🎯 DETECTED EVENT AGE: 15 days old ✅
🎯 CONFIDENCE: HIGH (23 articles from 8 sources)
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Cases to Validate
1. **Recent Events** (< 30 days): Should detect correctly and target short timeframes
2. **Medium Events** (30-180 days): Should target medium timeframes
3. **Older Events** (180+ days): Should target longer timeframes
4. **International Events**: Should work for global news
5. **No News Events**: Should gracefully fall back to video metadata

### Expected Test Results
```
✅ Charlie Kirk (15 days) → Targeted: 30 days search
✅ Nepal Riots (85 days) → Targeted: 100 days search  
✅ Old Political Event (400 days) → Targeted: 470 days search
