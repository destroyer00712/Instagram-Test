# Timeline Search Fix ðŸ“…

## Problem Solved

The original Google Fact Check API implementation had a hardcoded `maxAgeDays: 30` parameter, which caused the system to fail when users shared older content or when claims were older than 30 days.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Progressive Timeline Search Strategy ðŸ”„

The system now uses a progressive search approach that tries multiple timeline windows:

```javascript
const timelineStrategies = [
  { maxAgeDays: 30, description: "last 30 days" },     // Most recent
  { maxAgeDays: 90, description: "last 90 days" },     // 3 months
  { maxAgeDays: 365, description: "last year" },       // 1 year
  { maxAgeDays: 1825, description: "last 5 years" },   // 5 years
  { description: "all time" }                          // No limit
];
```

### 2. Smart Age Detection ðŸ§ 

The system attempts to detect video age from:
- **Caption text** - looks for date patterns like "2023-05-15", "May 15, 2023"
- **URL patterns** - extracts dates from Instagram URLs when possible
- **Common date formats** - MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, Month DD, YYYY

### 3. Optimized Search Strategy ðŸŽ¯

Based on detected age, the system starts from the most appropriate timeline:
- **0-30 days**: Start with "last 30 days"
- **31-90 days**: Start with "last 90 days"  
- **91-365 days**: Start with "last year"
- **1-5 years**: Start with "last 5 years"
- **>5 years or unknown**: Start with "all time"

## How It Works

### Before (Broken):
```
User shares 6-month-old video
â†“
System searches only last 30 days
â†“
No results found â†’ System fails
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User shares 6-month-old video
â†“
System detects age: ~180 days
â†“
Starts search with "last year" strategy
â†“
Finds relevant fact-checks â†’ Success!
```

### Progressive Fallback:
```
User shares recent video
â†“
Try "last 30 days" â†’ No results
â†“
Try "last 90 days" â†’ No results  
â†“
Try "last year" â†’ Found results!
â†“
Success with older fact-checks
```

## Enhanced Output

The system now provides transparency about its search strategy:

```javascript
{
  verdict: "False",
  confidence: "High",
  summary: "...",
  analysisDetails: {
    searchStrategy: "last year",
    totalStrategiesTried: 3,
    estimatedVideoAge: 180
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Timeline Failures** - System never fails due to age restrictions
2. **Intelligent Optimization** - Starts search from most likely timeline
3. **Complete Coverage** - Eventually searches all time if needed
4. **Performance Efficient** - Avoids unnecessary broad searches for recent content
5. **Transparent Reporting** - Users see which timeline strategy found results

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Recent Viral Video
- **Content**: Today's viral claim
- **Detection**: No date found
- **Strategy**: Progressive (30 days â†’ 90 days â†’ found!)
- **Result**: Quick discovery of recent fact-checks

### Scenario 2: Old Resurfaced Content  
- **Content**: "Breaking: 2019 election fraud evidence"
- **Detection**: Detects "2019" â†’ ~1400 days old
- **Strategy**: Starts with "last 5 years"
- **Result**: Finds historical fact-checks immediately

### Scenario 3: Undated Content
- **Content**: Generic conspiracy theory
- **Detection**: No date patterns found
- **Strategy**: Progressive search (30d â†’ 90d â†’ 1yr â†’ 5yr â†’ all time)
- **Result**: Comprehensive search ensures nothing is missed

## Technical Implementation

The fix is backward-compatible and adds these new functions:

- `detectVideoAge(videoUrl, caption)` - Age detection from metadata
- Enhanced `searchFactChecks(claim, videoUrl, caption)` - Progressive timeline search
- Timeline information in analysis results

No breaking changes to existing API or functionality.
